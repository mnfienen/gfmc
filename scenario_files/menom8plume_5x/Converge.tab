* This file, converge.tab, controls the number of iterations for groundwater flow solutions   
* by providing convergence criteria for the various types of analytic elements. These        
* criteria are values for "maximum errors in boundary conditions" (as reported in the          
* message.log file) that should not be exceeded. If all errors are smaller than those listed   
* in this file, the iteration process is aborted and the solutions is considered valid.
*
* NOTE: There is no critera for convergence of the surface water solution. The user must 
* set the "min. iterations" in this file at 5 or higher when conjunctive water and                  
* groundwater solutions are in effect. It remains the responsibility of the user to check the 
* surface water solution (see message.log file) for adequate convergence.
*
* NOTE: All lines below must be present in that order.
* Do not change element type names!
