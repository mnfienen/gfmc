* Format of the file "Relax.tab":
*
* * comment statement (* in first column)
* * iteration #     relaxation factor
   1                   0.5
   10                   0.8
   30                   1.0
 quit
*
*      The effect of this file is as follows: During the first 5 iterations a (under)relaxation factor
*      of 0.5 is used. During the next 3 iterations a relaxation factor of 0.8 is used, while after
*      that the relaxation factor is set to 0.9.
*      NOTE: The relaxation factor should NEVER be set larger than 1.0
